    "To figure out if these graphas are isomorphic we should ask ourselves the following questions.\n",
    "- Do the graphs have the same amount of vertices?\n",

    "What is a Bijection?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of graphs, a bijection is a type of function that maps the vertices of one graph to the vertices of another graph, in a way that preserves both the structure and the number of vertices. Bijections are both injective and surjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function example, take the graph image G and H above:\n",
    "A Bijection is a Function (f) that maps the vertices (V) of Graphs G and H in a way that each vertex in graph G is mapped to a unique vertex in graph H and vice versa. In other words f is both injective (one to one) and surjective (onto). \n",
    "f:(VG -> VH) if Vertices a1 and b1 are edges in G --> {f(a),f(b)} then these are also an edge in H (a2, b2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Injective (one to one) and Surjective (onto)\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, a function between two graphs can be classified as injective or surjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "An injective function is one where each vertex of the first graph (G) maps to a different vertex in the second graph (H). If there are two vertices in G that are adjacent to each other, their images in H must also be adjacent. If both grpahs were on a piece of paper they would be able to fold in on top of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "A surjective function is one where every vertex in the second graph (H) is the image of at least one vertex in the first graph (G). Every vertex in graph H can be reached by following a path from a vertex in G.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bijections are useful in graph theory for a variety of purposes, including comparing and contrasting different graphs, proving properties about graphs, and constructing new graphs from existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a simple graph like the one above it is easy to spot if a graph is isomorphic as concluding bijections is easy. But what about more complex graphs with many vertices, edges, degree sequences and cycle lengths? How do we conclude then if a graph is isomorphic? "
